During the making of Grimoire Bandits, we found game design and map building to be relaxing. And coding certain aspects of our game to be a fun challenge, despite some of our shortcomings. We also learned how to create a combat system, something we both never did
before we began this project. It took us weeks to get it to work. We would follow YouTube tutorials, as we did for the majority of our code, but there were still problems with enemy turns and how the health bar was managed. Even getting in and out of the battle menu was
quite a challenge, because we weren't sure how to break out the battle system. However, we could tie the battle menu with the mobs by placing a transition object inside the skeletons, mushroom creatures, and goblins. Overall, despite our ambitious attempt
at using 2D sprites in a 3D environment, we're proud we made it so far into the project. Although the battle system does have its issues, the timeline of our game runs smoothly, and it was an overall enjoyable endeavor!
