During the making of Grimoire Gambits, we found game design and map building to be relaxing. And coding certain aspects of our game to be a fun challenge, despite some of our shortcomings. We also learned how to create a combat system, something we both never did.
      Khai -Especially for me, since it's my first time working with C# - 

However, during the making of the combat system, it took us weeks to get it to work. We would follow YouTube tutorials and chat forums online, as we did for the majority of our code, but there were still problems with enemy turns and how the health bar was managed. Even getting in and out of the battle menu was quite a challenge, because we weren't sure how to break out of it. Despite that, we were able to 
tie the battle menu with the mobs by placing a transition object inside their models. 

Overall, despite our ambitious attempt at using 2D sprites in a 3D environment, we're proud we made it so far into the project. Although the battle system does have its issues and there are no NPCs or quests, the timeline of our game runs smoothly, and it was an overall enjoyable endeavor! 

We hope you enjoyed a snippet of what the game came out to be, and hope what we imagined it to be shines through. Thanks for watching!  :)
