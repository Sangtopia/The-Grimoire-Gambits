# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Grimoire Gambits

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An RPG turn-based game where the Player, mobs and npc are a 2D sprite that is in a 3D environment

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The envisioned project is an RPG turn-based game that combines 2D sprite characters with a 3D environment, offering a unique and visually engaging gameplay experience. The software will allow players to navigate through a three-dimensional world populated by 2D sprite characters, including the player's avatar, various mobs, and NPCs. The turn-based combat system will enable strategic encounters with mobs, each possessing distinct abilities and behaviors. The game will feature an immersive storyline, interactive dialogues with NPCs, and a dynamic quest system.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NONE

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for our final project involves the implementation of a functional turn-based combat system. we will have a fully operational player character no matter what

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We will ensure a fully operational player character with decent animation and movement, an OKAY map, the inclusion of interactive NPCs and challenging mobs within the 2D sprite and 3D environment and MAYBE a working turn-based combat with cards

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Hopefully we are able to polish the viusal and make out own pixel cards for the combats

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will need to learn and research on C## because we are using Unity, Emmanuel will be doing player scripts and mobs, Khai will do the menu system and we will both work on the combat system
